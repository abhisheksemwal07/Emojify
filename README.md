# emojify 🤖

Welcome to the Face to Emoji project, a Python script that transforms facial landmarks into emoji-like features in real-time. 🎭

## Overview

This project utilizes OpenCV and the `cvlearn` module to detect facial landmarks and overlay emoji-like elements on the detected face. The script captures video from a specified camera source, providing an engaging and interactive experience.

## Features

👀 **Dynamic Eyes:** Circular shapes representing the eyes dynamically change colors, creating expressive and lively features.

👁️ **Eyebrows:** Solid fill polygons simulate eyebrows, enhancing the realism of the emoji-like transformation.

😊 **Smiling Mouth:** An elliptical shape adjusts its dimensions based on facial features, simulating a smiling mouth. Additional features are added for a more realistic appearance.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV:** The core library for computer vision, providing the foundation for face detection and feature extraction.

- **cvlearn:** Utilized for FaceMesh detection, enabling accurate tracking of facial landmarks.
